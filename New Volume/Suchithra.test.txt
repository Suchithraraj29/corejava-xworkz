") what java &javac
  
java is a high level  object oriented  programing  laungauge 

    eg: class Namskara{
        public static void main (String[]){
          System.out.println("banni java kailiyona");
}
}
javac is a compiler to compile the program 

   2) explain  JDK,JRE,JVM

  jdk:java development kit, JRE:java runtime environment , JVM:java virtual  machine
      
    jdk: the java delopment kit it contains the java virtual machine , and set of libraries ,
        &development tools,java runtime environment 
      and jdk also it compiles the progrram & also it's help to the execution purpose
       JDK  exixt physically 

    JRE: the java run time environment it complies the program and  also it check the syntax of program
       JRE it's exist in physically 
           
      
     Jvm:  java virtual machine it contains the set of libraries &  jvm it's doesn't exist physically in floader
           

3) exapin array and also mention it's limitations

Arrays: it's a container it's stores the similiar type of data values/ data type into a single interference
     limitations of arrays:1. it's apply for only a similar type of data types
                            2. 
            sysntax: for(index=0 ; index<electronicDevice.length ; inex++ ){
              System.out.println("list of electronicsDevoces"){        

                        }
                        }

  4) explain class, obeject,signature of the class 

 Class: class defiens that it's the point where the program is starting & also it's contatin the class name
the class name is very important in program because the program type to save the program we use the class name.

 class name the fist letter must be in upper case
eg: class:ElectronicDevice
object:

Signature of the class: the class is also present in the outside the main 
& the out side the main we called as local variabel  


5)   difference b/w .java amd .class  

         .java:                                              .class

        1).java is used because the compile                         1) .class is not used in the run the program
          the program & execution purpose                            2) .class file is used when the program is written the .class name is used 
         2) it's used because the save file as .java                  3) to save the program same as the class file nmae as 
          3) comile the program
          4) run the program 

6) explain ide's
  notepad , eclipse,

  7) what is java

    java is a high level object oriented programing launguage 

9 expalin variable and it's types

variable is container it's the data values or varivale is a container it's the values 
       Types

     4types of varibales
 local variable: the local variable is the inside the main 
static variable: the loacl variable is the outside the main


10) expain class variabel

class variable
it' s container it's store the valures

11) explain data types and mention it's types

   data types types
  they are two types of data types
   1. non primitive
    2.  primitive

In non primitive they are 8 types are
   double, int ,flag, char, boolean, 
the non primitive data type it  contains the default value

In prmitive
 String
the primitive data type it's doesn't contain any default value
 
12 explain java features

   java features
  1. java is secured
  2. java is easy to understand 
   3. any one can contribute
  4. easy to comiple and easy to write the code
 5. main features is write once run anytime(WORA)
 

13)explain base class all class

14) explain  methods and types
   
15) write any one program based on variavles , methods,arrays,methodoverloading
    based on variables

   class Bakkery{

     static String biscuitName= "cream biscuit";
     static String biscuitName1= "oreo";
 static String biscuitName2= "chask-mask";
 static String biscuitName3= "fiftyfifty";
 static StringbiscuitName4= "unibic";
 static StringbiscuitName5= "parlegy";
 static String biscuitName6= "darkfantsy";

 public static void main(String Biscuits[]){

System.out.println("main statred");
System.out.println("the list of biscuits are:");
System.out.println( "the biscuitName is" + biscuitName);
System.out.println( "the biscuitName1 is" + biscuitName1);
System.out.println( "the biscuitName2 is" + biscuitName2);
System.out.println( "the biscuitName3 is" + biscuitName3);
System.out.println( "the biscuitName4 is" + biscuitName4);
System.out.println( "the biscuitName5 is" + biscuitName5);
System.out.println( "the biscuitName6 is" + biscuitName6);
System.out.println("main ended");
}
}
 




16) write the program based on initialize and declare an arrays
    class Hotelsharavathi{

      static String FoodNames("palav", "vangibath" , "berayani", "rice bath", " setdosa" , "kabab" , " plane pakav" , " lemonrice" , "masaladosa");
        public static void main (String foods[]){

        System.out.println( "main  started");
 System.out.println( "wlecome to the sharavth hotel");
      System.out.println( " THE lis of foods are:");
      System.out.println(FoodNames[]+ " " + 
        FoodNames[]1+ " " + FoodNames[]2+ " " + 
        FoodNames[]3+ " " + FoodNames[]4+ " " + 
        FoodNames[]5+ " " + FoodNames[]6+ " " + 
FoodNames[]7+ " " + FoodNames[]8+ " " + );
 System.out.println( "main  ended");
 System.out.println( "thank you visit again");
}
}
